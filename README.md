# Artsy Web App Project

## Description
Artâ€™sy is a web application that contains a collection of art pieces and artists and allows you to see the current location of the artworks.
Aimed to collect works of art from all over the world on a single platform.

- Used three different models, including art, artist and user.
- Used Express as a foundation.
- Used Mongoose for models and database communication.
- Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
